#NCD
==================

This project is a very simple weekly appointment scheduler for psychologists. Where all the data is stored on the blockchain. Patients can create a appointment using this application.After they create a new appointment the price for that appointment will taken from their account and will be transferred to the contract. Moreover, the psychologist can view their appointments for the current week.



Quick Start
===========

To run this project locally:

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you've installed [Node.js] â‰¥ 12
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Run the local development server: `yarn dev` (see `package.json` for a
   full list of `scripts` you can run with `yarn`)


Exploring The Code
==================

1. The "backend" code lives in the `/contract` folder. See the README there for
   more info.
2. The frontend code lives in the `/src` folder. `/src/main.js` is a great
   place to start exploring.
